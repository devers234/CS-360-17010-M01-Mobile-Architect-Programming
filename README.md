Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

 The app I designed was an inventory app for Magic the gathering users. It allows users to login, create a new account and add or remove cards from their inventory. 

 What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  One important screen was the user login screen. This allows for users to login to see their database. Another important screen is the inventory screen. From this screen, the user can add, or remove the amount of items they have. This is one of the most important screens because it is where the user will be interacting with the most. I tried to keep the UI clean and pleasing to the eyes because a bad UI can turn people away from apps.

  How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

   What I did was test my code after writing any new section of code. I wanted to make sure the syntax was correct and whatever I added did not crash the app. In my project I had the app working, when I went to configure some database code, it caused the app to keep crashing I had to keep testing and playing with the code until the app stopped crashing. Testing after each section will be something I use going forward. This helped me save time because it was easier to identify any issues. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

 One way I tested my code was run the app in the Android studio. I did this to see what errors the Android Studio was displaying and what my app looked like in the emulator. Usually, the app studio gave me where and what the errors were, when I had an issue with the app crashing, I was able to locate the logs and see the issue. 

 Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  One way I had to overcome a challenge was with the design phase. I had issues coming up with ideas on what my app would do and look like. I spent some time researching and brainstorming before deciding what I wanted my app to look like. Another issue I had to find a way to overcome was the code having issues running. I had issues with my code missing parts when submitting my projects. I had to play around with my computer settings before fixing it. 

  In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

 One area was the account login and creation screen. When I was testing, I was able to make an account and password. I was also able to login using those credentials. I tried to make another account with the same username and it would not let me. I think that section was done right because it did not allow me to make duplicate accounts and it allowed me to login.
